Assignment Overview
Build an AI-powered CSV Importer that can intelligently extract CRM lead information from any valid CSV format.
The challenge is not parsing CSV files.
The challenge is allowing users to upload CSVs with different column names, layouts, and structures, while your system accurately maps and extracts the required CRM fields using AI.
For example, these should all work:
Facebook Lead Export
Google Ads Export
Excel sheets
Real Estate CRM exports
Sales reports
Marketing agency CSVs
Manually created spreadsheets
Your application should identify the appropriate fields and convert them into GrowEasy CRM format.

Functional Requirements
The project consists of both a Frontend and Backend.

Frontend Requirements
Create a responsive web application.
Step 1 — Upload CSV
Allow users to upload a valid CSV file.
Examples:
Drag & Drop upload
File Picker

Step 2 — Preview
After upload:
Parse the CSV
Show a preview of uploaded rows
Display data inside a beautiful responsive table
Table should support:
Horizontal scrolling
Vertical scrolling
Sticky headers (preferred)
Responsive design
No AI processing should happen yet.

Step 3 — Confirm Import
Provide a Confirm button.
Only after confirmation should the frontend call the backend API.

Step 4 — Display Parsed Result
Backend returns AI-extracted CRM records.
Display the parsed result in another responsive table.
Show:
Successfully parsed records
Skipped records (if any)
Total imported
Total skipped

Backend Requirements
Create APIs that:
1. Accept CSV Upload
Accept any valid CSV file.
Do not assume column names are fixed.

2. Parse CSV
Convert the CSV into records.

3. AI Extraction
Send records to an AI model in batches.
The AI should intelligently map available fields into GrowEasy CRM format.
You may use OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or any equivalent LLM.

4. Return Structured JSON
Return extracted CRM records in JSON format.

CRM Fields
Your AI should extract as many of the following fields as possible.

AI Instructions
Your AI should follow these rules while extracting records.
1. Allowed CRM Status Values
Only use one of:
GOOD_LEAD_FOLLOW_UP
DID_NOT_CONNECT
BAD_LEAD
SALE_DONE

2. Allowed Data Source Values
Only use one of:
leads_on_demand
meridian_tower
eden_park
varah_swamy
sarjapur_plots
If none match confidently, leave it blank.

3. Date Format
created_at must be convertible using JavaScript:
new Date(created_at)


4. CRM Notes
Use crm_note for:
Remarks
Follow-up notes
Additional comments
Extra phone numbers
Extra email addresses
Any useful information that doesn't fit another field

5. Multiple Emails or Mobile Numbers
If multiple email addresses exist:
Use the first email.
Append remaining emails into crm_note.
If multiple mobile numbers exist:
Use the first mobile.
Append remaining numbers into crm_note.

6. CSV Compatibility
Each record must remain a single CSV row.
Avoid introducing unintended line breaks.
If line breaks are necessary, escape them appropriately (for example, \n) so the CSV remains valid.

7. Skip Invalid Records
If a record contains neither:
email
nor
mobile number
then skip that record.
